					<div class="text">
						<p>Clean, safe drinking water is scarce. Today, nearly 1 billion people in the developing world don't have access to it. Yet, we take it for granted, we waste it, and we even pay too much to drink it from little plastic bottles.</p>
						<p>Water is the foundation of life. And still today, all around the world, far too many people spend their entire day searching for it.</p>
						<p>In places like sub-Saharan Africa, time lost gathering water and suffering from water-borne diseases is limiting people's true potential.</p>
						<p>Education is lost to sickness. Economic development is lost while people merely try to survive. But it doesn't have to be like this. It's needless suffering.</p>
						<p>Simply put, water scarcity is either the lack of enough water (quantity) or lack of access to safe water (quality).</p>
						<p>It's hard for most of us to imagine that clean, safe water is not something that can be taken for granted. But, in the developing world, finding a reliable source of safe water is often time consuming and expensive. This is known as economic scarcity. Water can be found...it simply requires more resources to do it.</p>

						<div class="text">
							<p>Every day in rural communities and poor urban centers throughout sub-Saharan Africa, hundreds of millions of people suffer from a lack of access to clean, safe water.</p>
							<p>Women and girls especially bear the burden of walking miles at a time to gather water from streams and ponds - full of water-borne disease that is making them and their families sick.</p>
							<p>Illness from drinking dirty water and the time lost fetching it robs entire communities of their futures.</p>
							<p>Hope is put on hold in over half of the developing world's primary schools without access to water and sanitation.</p>
							<p>It left us wondering why. So, we decided to help. We'd like you to join us.</p>

					<h1 class="sectionTitle">How We Work?</h1>
						<div class="text">
							<p>The Water Project brings relief to communities around the world who suffer needlessly from a lack of access to clean water and proper sanitation.</p>
							<p>Providing access to clean, safe water helps capable and determined people realize the hope they have for their own futures.</p>
							<p>The Water Project works closely with local in-country teams and partners to develop clean water programs alongside these heroes. We carefully select implementing partners who have long term relationships and commitments to the people they serve.</p>
							<p>We're passionate about unlocking potential. After all, water doesn't change anything; the people we serve do.</p>
							<p>We work hard to make sure that a community's needs are always considered first. Local partners in the field help ensure that happens. With your support, we are able to provide funds to various project types, so that the partners we trust are free to make the best possible decisions.</p>

							<p>The following describes how a well project is completed.</p>

							<ol>
								<li>Community Engagement: Learn why the communties we serve are involved at every step of the process. Find out why it's critical to success.</li><br>
								<li>Community Education: Clean, safe water can be a new concept in a village. Understanding concepts like hand-washing and proper use of latrines is key to maximizing the benefits of a new well.</li><br>
								<li>Installing the Project: From filing for permits to installing a well pump or other hardware, a lot goes into the construction phase of a water project like a well. Learn how our partner drills a well.</li><br>
								<li>Education Follow-Up and Handing Over: The exciting moment when water flows and a community celebrates their new water source is just the beginning.</li><br>
								<li>Monitoring and Evaluation: Did it work? Is it still working? Was anyone really helped? If we don't ask, we'll never know. Discover why follow-up is so essential.</li><br>
